## Let me see it!

Just go to my [polygon app](https://polygon-856a1.web.app/)

## Technologies used

* **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: My favorite javascript library so far. I am fond of frameworks like angular as well, but to me react is simply easier to use and faster to work with.
* **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Really simple to use and to learn either if you know JS or not.
* **CSS**: Although I see advantage in tools like [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), I believe the language used for styling will keep being the standard in web development, and CSS itself is really useful for small projects.
* **[Firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Currently I serve the webpage on firebase hosting. 
* **[Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions)**: The basic build and deployment is executed from github servers via github actions.
